                                        <p>Startups that have a great product their customers love can benefit from public relations in more ways than one. Aside from the obvious benefit of publicity, entrepreneurs gain credibility. As a start up, what you probably really need is a partner in communicating the right messaging. Often enough, as a start up, the founders and core members are so engrossed with creating an excellent product, that what the world thinks of you becomes secondary. Also fact remains, that as a product (in your offering being a user-based commodity), you have the power to make a difference to several stakeholders. This can be achieved not by flooding the media with knowledge, but awareness to the right people about you. Whether it is immediate target users, possible scalable users, opinion seekers, and eventually perhaps even policy changers in the economy. </p>
